Welcome to the BlueOS Developer Documentation — your guide to building with BlueOS, a powerful systemOS exclusively tailored to JetBlue. Inside, you’ll find everything you need: how the system works, how to use the APIs, and how to get started.

## Installation

!!! tip

    If you're not already familiar with Roblox’s programming language, **LuaU**, we recommend taking some time to learn the basics. It’s a lightweight and beginner-friendly language, and understanding it will make working with BlueOS much smoother—especially when using its scripting and automation features.

!!! warning

    This system was developed using Roblox Studio `2.683.774`. Over time, updates to Roblox may cause parts of the system to become incompatible. In such cases, certain segments of the code may need to be updated to restore full compatibility.
